              <p className="mb-4">
                Ayurveda, which translates to "The Science of Life," is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. It originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The knowledge of Ayurveda was passed down orally through generations, from accomplished masters to their disciples. Later, this knowledge was organized in text form, which today is known as the Vedas.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The principles of Ayurveda are found in ancient texts called the Vedas, particularly in the Atharvaveda. The most famous Ayurvedic texts are:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Charaka Samhita</strong> - Focused on internal medicine and considered the oldest and most important Ayurvedic text.</li>
                <li><strong>Sushruta Samhita</strong> - Emphasized surgical techniques and procedures with remarkable detail.</li>
                <li><strong>Ashtanga Hridaya</strong> - A concise compilation of earlier texts that served as a complete manual for Ayurvedic practitioners.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-playfair font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-primary-green">The Three Doshas</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Central to Ayurvedic philosophy is the concept of three doshas or energies that govern physiological activity:

              <p className="mb-4">
                Ayurveda spread to other parts of Asia with the expansion of Buddhism. During the medieval period, Ayurvedic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In the modern era, there has been a global revival of interest in Ayurveda. The World Health Organization recognizes Ayurveda as a traditional medicine system, and many countries have established governmental departments for AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Ayurveda continues to evolve with scientific research validating many of its principles and practices, while AI technology helps make this ancient wisdom more accessible and personalized for modern wellness seekers.
